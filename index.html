        <h2>Addendum: Process and Creative Choices</h2>
        <p>During the development of this interactive story game, I focused on creating an engaging narrative with multiple paths and endings. I structured the game using HTML for layout, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality. One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring that all story paths were reachable and that images displayed correctly. I overcame these challenges through thorough testing and debugging. This process taught me the importance of planning and testing in web development, as even small errors can significantly impact user experience.</p>
